# Chatbot Project

## Overview

This project is a simple chatbot developed using Python and the Trainer module library. The chatbot is designed to interact with users by greeting them and cracking jokes. It is an ongoing project with future enhancements planned, but the current functionalities are already in place to provide a basic yet engaging user experience.

## Features

- **User Greeting**: The chatbot can greet users in a friendly manner, making the interaction feel welcoming and personal.
- **Joke Telling**: Equipped with a sense of humor, the chatbot can crack jokes to entertain users and lighten the conversation.


## Usage

To run the chatbot, use the following command:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Once the chatbot is running, it will prompt you for input and respond with greetings or jokes based on your interaction.
